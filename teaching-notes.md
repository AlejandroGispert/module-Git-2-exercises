# Teaching notes

## Purpose of exercise 1 / things to talk about

First attempt: it'll be chaos. It should be possible to make all of the PRs, but merging them will go much less well. We'll get stuck on a merge conflict, but let's merge as many as we can (leave the indent one to last).

Then talk about conflicts. Why, theory, resolving.

Then, together, let's resolve the conflicts and merge the PRs.

Let's then reset `main` to as it was before, and do it all again, but this time, collaborating and communicating, before we start, and as we go.

- Does each requirement make sense? Do we understood what we're being asked to do? Do we need any more information?

- Do all the requirements _together_ make sense?

- Can we drop any of the requirements entirely?

- Can we group some of the requirements into a small number of PRs?
